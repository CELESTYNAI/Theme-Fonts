## Implementing fonts in a discord theme for mobile is pretty easy and straightforward, here is how to do it:

>## Please refer to [this guide](https://docs.riichi.tech/objects/raw-colors) on how to make a theme for mobile discord, currrently [Bunny](https://github.com/pyoncord/Bunny), [Revenge](https://github.com/revenge-mod) & [Vendetta (EOL)](https://github.com/vendetta-mod) supports theming. More discord client mod support will be added in the future when they are released...
## Prerequisites:
>## You need to have a `.json` file for your themes to work on mobile discord `(this method doesn't work on PC/web discord)`. Open the `.json` file in your preferred editor, I use windows notepad, you can use notepad too if you are not sure what to use.
# Adding font code snippet into your `.json` file: 
>## Method 1- 
>## Just copy/paste the [code snippet](https://github.com/Rairof/Theme-Fonts/blob/main/assets/Code-snippet) provided in this repository into your `.json` file at the end of your [rawcolour strings](https://docs.riichi.tech/objects/raw-colors) i.e, just below these highlighted strings-
>![these strings](./rawcolours.png)
>### Then, replace the `Font-Name` within all the links provided in the snippet with the font you want from the repository and save changes.
>## NOTE-
>### Please ensure correct font names are replaced along with the link directory to said font files in the repository for the fonts to work, otherwise yout theme will cause unwanted crashes.
>## Method 2-
>### Just copy & paste the code snippet provided at the end of each theme pictures in Gallery section into your `.json` in the same position as `Method 1` i.e at the end of your [rawcolour strings](https://docs.riichi.tech/objects/raw-colors).

>## Usage-
>### Most of the string's usage are listed in [here.](https://github.com/Rairof/Theme-Fonts/tree/main/assets/Font-string-usage)
